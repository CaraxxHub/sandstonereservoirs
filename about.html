                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>The School of Sandstone Reservoirs advances scientific understanding and practical application of sandstone systems across the full spectrum of subsurface energy challenges. We unite rigorous academic research with industry innovation, training geoscientists to address both traditional hydrocarbon development and emerging energy transition needs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Sandstone Reservoirs Matter</h2>
                <p>Sandstone reservoirs are among Earth's most economically and societally important geological formations. They:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Host the majority of global conventional oil and gas reserves</li>
                    <li>Store groundwater for billions of people worldwide</li>
                    <li>Serve as targets for geothermal energy extraction</li>
                    <li>Provide essential sites for CO₂ sequestration</li>
                    <li>Offer potential for hydrogen storage and lithium extraction</li>
                    <li>Enable underground energy storage systems</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite their critical importance, sandstone reservoir science often exists in disciplinary silos. The School of Sandstone Reservoirs breaks down these barriers by integrating provenance analysis, sedimentology, stratigraphy, diagenesis, and reservoir engineering into a unified framework.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Our Approach: From Source to Sink and Beyond</h2>
                <p>We emphasize the complete sandstone system through the lens of <strong>Sediment Routing Systems</strong> — frameworks that link the fate of particulate sediment from source to sink. This approach frames the problems of denudation, sediment transport and deposition as a box model characterised by sources, reservoirs and sinks with connecting fluxes.</p>
                
                <p>Sediment routing systems are controlled and perturbed by the interplay of tectonics and climate, and the related response of drainage lithologies. The system is linked by transfer of sediment between three key segments:</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Erosional Engine</strong> — The source area where sediment is generated through weathering and erosion processes, controlled by tectonics, climate, and lithology.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Transfer Zone</strong> — The pathway through which sediment moves from source to sink, where hydraulic sorting, abrasion, and temporary storage modify sediment characteristics.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Long-term Sink</strong> — The final depositional basin where sediment accumulates, undergoes burial, and transforms through diagenesis into reservoir rock.</p>
                
                <h3>Sediment Generation</h3>
                <p>Our approach is based on the dynamics determining the generation and release of sediments by source areas. The focus on simulation (or forward modelling) of sediment compositions — including both primary detritus and secondary authigenic materials — is highly complementary to quantitative provenance analysis, which has a strong inverse modelling emphasis as it aims to infer source-area characteristics from the properties of the erosional products.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Diagenesis</strong> — Investigating burial history, compaction, cementation, and fluid-rock interactions that transform sediment into rock and control reservoir quality.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Energy Applications</strong> — Applying fundamental knowledge to oil and gas production, geothermal systems, CO₂ storage, hydrogen economy, and emerging technologies.</p>

                <h2>History & Evolution</h2>
                
                <h3>From Diagenesis to Reservoir Systems: Our Rebrand</h3>
                <p>The School was originally established as the <strong>"School on Controls on Sandstone Diagenesis"</strong>, reflecting our initial focus on post-depositional processes. Over six editions spanning multiple continents, we recognized that truly understanding reservoir quality requires a more expansive vision — one that integrates the entire sedimentary system from source to subsurface application.</p>
                
                <p>In 2025, we evolved into the <strong>School of Sandstone Reservoirs</strong>, embracing a holistic approach that connects sediment generation, transport, deposition, and diagenesis to real-world energy challenges. This rebrand reflects our commitment to bridging fundamental science with society's urgent need for sustainable energy solutions.</p>

                <h3>Six Editions Across Three Continents</h3>
                
                <p><strong>1st-3rd Editions: FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany</strong><br>
                The School began at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, establishing core principles in diagenetic analysis, provenance methods, and reservoir quality prediction.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4th Edition: University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA</strong><br>
                Expanding internationally, the fourth edition marked a pivotal shift toward integrating energy transition topics alongside traditional hydrocarbon applications.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5th Edition: University of Granada, Spain</strong><br>
                Continuing our evolution, the Granada edition deepened our focus on renewable energy applications, including geothermal systems and carbon storage technologies.</p>
                
                <p><strong>6th Edition: Coming in 2026</strong><br>
                The next chapter of the School of Sandstone Reservoirs is currently in development, with details to be announced. Building on our established tradition of excellence and our evolution toward energy transition focus, the 6th edition will continue to unite academic rigor with industry innovation.</p>
