                <h3>Dr. Luca Caracciolo</h3>
                <p class="affiliation">Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Germany</p>

                    <p>Luca Caracciolo's research centres on Sediment Routing Systems and Sediment Generation — two complementary branches of sedimentary geology that he integrates through Quantitative Provenance Analysis. His work advances approaches that use compositional and textural data not merely to identify sediment sources, but to quantify the relative impacts of tectonics, climate, and lithology on sediment generation and flux, enabling predictive models for both Earth history reconstruction and applied subsurface challenges.</p>

                    <p>A central theme of his research is connecting pre-depositional dynamics — provenance, climate, transport history, depositional facies — to diagenetic pathways and reservoir quality. His experimental diagenesis programme combines laboratory simulation of early cementation with digital rock physics (microCT imaging and digital sedimentary petrology modelling) to predict porosity-permeability evolution, with direct applications to carbon capture and storage, geothermal energy, and hydrocarbon exploration.</p>

                    <p>Luca founded the School of Sandstone Reservoirs in 2017 in collaboration with Rob Lander and Linda Bonnell of Geocosm LLC.</p>

                    <p>Linda Bonnell leads Geocosm's geoscience research efforts and directs many of the company's reservoir quality prediction and risk assessment studies. She has been instrumental in developing Geocosm's Touchstone and Cyberstone systems for reservoir quality assessment — industry-standard tools used globally for predicting sandstone properties in the subsurface.</p>

                    <p>Linda served as an AAPG Distinguished Lecturer in 2003-2004, delivering presentations on diagenesis and reservoir quality to audiences worldwide. Her research has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including a paper that received the prestigious Wallace E. Pratt Memorial Award for best paper in the AAPG Bulletin in 2010.</p>

                    <p>Rob has published over 25 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals over the past decade and is the author of four "notable papers" in the AAPG Bulletin, including one that received the Wallace E. Pratt Memorial Award for best paper. He served as an AAPG Distinguished Lecturer in 2015, co-edited a special issue of the AAPG Bulletin on sandstone reservoir quality prediction in 2010, and co-convened a Hedberg Conference and a meeting hosted by the Geological Society of London.</p>
