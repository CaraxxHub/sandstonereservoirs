                    <p>Luca Caracciolo's research integrates quantitative provenance analysis with basin evolution studies, focusing on the relationships between tectonics, sedimentation, and diagenesis. His methodological expertise spans sedimentary petrology, heavy mineral analysis, detrital geochemistry, and low-temperature thermochronology (fission track and U-Th/He dating). He employs advanced analytical techniques including Raman spectroscopy and QEMSCAN to model compositional data and link sediment mineralogy to pre- and post-depositional processes.</p>
                    
                    <p>His applied research addresses critical challenges in the oil & gas and geothermal industries, particularly enhanced interpretation of facies heterogeneity, reservoir connectivity, and diagenetic controls on fluid migration. With combined academic and industry experience, Luca has worked on projects across all continents, including Europe, North and South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
                    
                    <p>Luca serves as Chief Editor for the Sedimentary Geology special volume "Sediment Generation and Provenance: Process and Pathways" and the forthcoming "Sediment Generation and Sediment Routing Systems" in Earth Science Reviews.
